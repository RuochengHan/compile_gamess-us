# Gamess US 2020R1 socket compile

```bash
./config
```
choose the prefix the same as the folder
choose openblas as math labrary
see https://github.com/RuochengHan/Compile_packages/blob/master/packages_20200927.md
for openblas serial version compilation
choose socket as parallel scheme
choose no to three more features at last
choose no to openmp support (openblas not supported somehow...)

```bash
cd ddi
compddi >& compddi.log &
cp ddikick.x ../
compall >& compall.log &
```
Check in compall.log to make sure no "Error"

```bash
lked 00 >& lked.log &
```
Check in lked.log to make sure no "Error"

set SCR, USERSCR, GMSPATH
Note that gms-files.csh shoule be in the folder of USERSCR (use cp)

Then you will have gamess.00.x in the folder

**Run Gamess**
```bash
/path-to-gamess/rungms INPUT.inp 00 16 > OUTPUT
```

# Gamess US 2020R1 mpi compile

Similar as socket, except the following:
1) 
choose mpi as parallel scheme, and mpich (openmpi somehow not work...)
see https://github.com/RuochengHan/Compile_packages/blob/master/packages_20200927.md
for mpich compilation
2) 
```bashcp ddikick.x ../```
is not needed
3)
do not use rungms but the one in:
